Description: Shark Machine Learning Library
 SHARK is a modular C++ library for the design and
 optimization of adaptive systems. It provides methods for linear and
 nonlinear optimization, in particular evolutionary and gradient-based
 algorithms, kernel-based learning algorithms and neural networks, and
 various other machine learning techniques. SHARK serves as a toolbox
 to support real world applications as well as research indifferent
 domains of computational intelligence and machine learning. The
 sources are compatible with the following platforms: Windows, Solaris,
 MacOS X, and Linux.
