Trainers
========

Trainers offer one of the simplest interfaces in Shark, but also form
a very diverse group of algorithms for a range of different settings
and applications. Each trainer represents a one-step solver for one
certain machine learning problem. Usually, it will adapt the parameters
of a model such that it represents the solution to some machine learning
or data processing problem given a certain data set.

Some trainers are very simple -- for example those training a linear
model such that it normalizes the components of all examples in a data
set to unit variance. Other trainers are quite complex, for example for
some multi-class support vector machines. But in most cases, trainers
are used to reach analytical solutions to relatively simple problems
which are not stated as an iterative optimization problem underneath.



The base class 'AbstractTrainer<ModelT, LabelTypeT>'
----------------------------------------------------

:doxy:`AbstractTrainer` is the base interface for trainers for supervised
learning problems. It is templatized with respect to the type of model it
trains and the type of label in the data set. The trainer then defines the
following types in its public interface:


==========================   =======================================
Types                        Description
==========================   =======================================
``ModelType``                The type of model the trainer optimizes
``InputType``                The type of inputs the model takes
``LabelType``                The type of the labels in the data set
==========================   =======================================


A trainer offers the following methods:


=========================================================   =================================================
Method                                                      Description
=========================================================   =================================================
``train(ModelType&, LabeledData<InputType, LabelType>)``    Solves the problem and sets the model parameters
``configure(PropertyTree)``                                 Configures the trainer
``std::string name()``                                      Returns the trainer's name
=========================================================   =================================================


Usage of trainers is equally straightforward::

  MyModel model;
  MyTrainer trainer;
  MyDataset data;
  trainer.configure(...);      //optional
  trainer.train(model, data);  //model now represents the solution to the problem.



The base class 'AbstractUnsupervisedTrainer<ModelT>'
----------------------------------------------------


:doxy:`AbstractUnsupervisedTrainer` is the base interface for trainers for
unsupervised learning poblems. It only needs to know about the model type,
and offers a typedef for the data format:


==========================   ==============================================
Types                        Description
==========================   ==============================================
``ModelType``                Type of model which the trainer optimizes
``InputType``                Type of inputs the model takes
==========================   ==============================================


These trainers also offer the following methods:


=====================================================   ================================================
Method                                                  Description
=====================================================   ================================================
``train(ModelType&, UnlabeledData<InputType>)``         Solves the problem and stores it in the model.
``configure(PropertyTree)``                             Configures the trainer
``std::string name()``                                  Returns the name of the trainer
=====================================================   ================================================
